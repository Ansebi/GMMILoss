Differentiable Mutual information Loss with pytorch  

1. Train a GM
2. Estimate MI using covarience matrix (easy)
3. Consruct a loss function with estimated covarience matrix and means
4. BackPropagate!

Todo: 

-[] update code 
-[] works quite bad with High dimensional data,  check this paper: https://openreview.net/forum?id=SvrYl-FDq2
